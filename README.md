## Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**
   First, you need to install all the necessary dependencies. Run the following command in your terminal:
 ```npm install```


2. **Setup Environment Variables**
   Copy the example environment file to create your own `.env` file. This file will store your API key for the Apex Legends API.
```cp .env.example .env```
Open the `.env` file and replace the placeholder with your actual Apex Legends API key. You can get your API key from [Apex Legends API](https://apexlegendsapi.com/).

3. **Start the Development Server**
Finally, start the development server with the following command:
 ```npm run dev```
Your ViteJS app should now be running locally!
